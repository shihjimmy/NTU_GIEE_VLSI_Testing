> This repo contains all the homework from this course.  

# PA1
- ### **Single stuck-at faults simulation and dropping in VLSI testing**
- **Key Functions:**
  - Fault simulation using a parallel fault simulation algorithm.
  - Determine when should we do the Fault dropping.  

# PA2
- ### **PODEM algorithm for automatic test patterns generation**
- **Key Functions:**
  - Implementation of the PODEM algorithm for test pattern generation.
  - Fault simulation using the parallel fault simulation algorithm.

# PA3
- ### **Transition Delay Fault (TDF) Simulation for VLSI Testing**
- **Key Functions:**
  - Implementation of TDF simulation using launch-on-shift (LOS) technique.
  - Fault list generation for TDF without fault collapsing.
  - Steps to build the TDF simulator, including compiling and running in tdfsim mode.
